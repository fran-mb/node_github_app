// We did an exercise to create a project in github with the exercises.
// Eventually, we want to add Travis to that project to be executed with all Pull Requests.
// These are the steps we did


/*
1. Install in the command line 'git', 'npm' - It was already DONE
2. Create a 'node.js' app with the command 'npm init' - and use the default values - DONE
3. Create a project in 'Github' Website and link it with 'git remote add origin <URL>'
4. Copy/paste Carlos exercises, commit it and push to master with command 'git push origin master'
5. Review two exercises. Day 1 and Day 3.

/*
To do next:
6. Add some tests
7. Install Travis
8. Run tests in Travis for new Pull Requests

/*
Commands we learned:

1. npm --version // To know which npm or other tool/library is installed
2. npm -v // Same as above
3. cd Home // cd is change directory and HOME is the directory
4. node init // to create a project in node
5. git init // to initialise a github project
6. git remote origin <URL> // To link your project with the remote copy in Github
6. git push origin master // to push your master branch to the origin github URL
